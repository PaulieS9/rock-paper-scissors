I created a basic rock, paper, scissors game that can be played in the console.

I had to learn how to use arrays and the different methods to manipulate them. I also had to understand the structure of a project with JavaScript and experiment with using different scopes. I used a number of different functions to create a game with 5 rounds that displays the score after every round.
